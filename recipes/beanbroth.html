    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p>I have not included quantity for any of of the ingredients. That's totally up to you. If you're making this just for yourself then use one carrot, one onion and one celery stalk. If you are cooking for several people, bump up the amount to suit. This is about preference too. Please feel free to add your favourite vegetable. Add pre cooked shredded chicken and omit the Chorizo to the pot 10 minutes before serving to make this a beany chicken soup.</p>
